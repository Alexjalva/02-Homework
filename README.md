# 02-Homework - Horiseon Landing Page Refactoring
##Repository for Homework 2 - Horiseon Site

The Horiseon landing page needs to look clean, be accessible, and be functional. The page is set up into 5 sections: Navigation header, Hero banner, Benefits section, Benefits aside, and Footer.
The sections are set up such that the user can arrive on the page, quickly find and use any navigation as needed at the top, or scroll down to find the information logically laid out. 
Sections are appropriately labeled with semantic tags in the HTML and alt text is provided for any images that would otherwise provide the text on screen. 

##Installation

All files needed are contained within the repository. The main folder needs to include the assets folder and the index.html file. As long as all files are included, and placed in that order, the html should be able to find the images based on relative path. 

##Usage

Webpage can be loaded based off of html in main repository. 

##Credits
Original page was created by Trilogy education.
